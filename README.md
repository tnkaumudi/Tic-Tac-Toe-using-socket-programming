# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-socket-programming
Programmatically enable a multiplayer game of Tic Tac Toe using socket programming in Python.
To understand TCP connections using socket programming by accepting inputs from the client and server and using them to create a unique version of the popular game- Tic Tac Toe.
Working : One end of the TCP connection is attached to the client socket and the other end is attached to a server socket.When creating the TCP connection, we associate with it the client socket address (IP address and port number) and the server socket address.With the TCP connection established, when one side wants to send data to the other side, it just drops the data into the TCP connection via its socket.
